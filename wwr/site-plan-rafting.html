    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to draw in potential customers and persuade them to purchase tickets 
      for a white water rafting trip. The site should be simple, easy to use, and visually appealing. It 
      should have a natural progressing from shing information to asking for a purchase. Ideally this 
      transition should not be noticed or at least be very unnoticable.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The target customers are perople who want to go white water rafting as a group. This could include 
      people who are doing it for a youth group or a company outing or it simply be a parent who wants to 
      have a fun experience with their family. This means that their financial situation could range from 
      quite well off to making a fairly average and possibly below average salary. The age range to go on 
      a trip like this would probably range from about twelve or thirteen to about 40 to 50. These people 
      would probably have a range of interests and could be doing it just because it is a different and 
      intersting activity but it is most likely that they will probalby be a group of people who do outdoor
      activities faorly regularly and enjoy the outdoors. These people will be primarily concerned with 
      safety but will still want an exciting adventure for their group. They will probably on the lookout 
      for group deals. The colors should be fun and keep a nice outdoorsy theme but they should not be too 
      overbearing. The fonts should be similar to the colors and general themeing. They will most likely 
      access the site from a laptop or mobile device but they verywell could still be using a desktop.</p>
