                    Hello, my name is Ethan Leishman. I am 17 years old and 
                    this is my first semster at BYU-I. I am pursuing a BS in 
                    computer science. I am from Nampa, Idaho which is about 
                    30 minutes away from Boise. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obviously I am not married. I have been a member of the 
                    Church for my entire life.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    I have some experience with HTML and CSS but it has been 
                    a while and I have forgotten a good deal of what I had 
                    previously learned. I'm hoping to be able to remind 
                    myself of everything I have forgotten and also learn 
                    some new things about web design. While I probably won't 
                    be going into web design as a career it will be nice to 
                    be able to creaete my own websites and have those skills 
                    if the need ever arises.</p>
