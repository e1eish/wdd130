        <h1 class="horology-explain">What is Horology?</h1>
        <p class="horology-explain">Horology is the study and measurement of time. Clocks, watches, sundials, hourglasses, and digital timers are all examples of instruments that measure time. In the current day horology tends to refer to the study of mechanical timekeeping devices. <br><br>Chronometry, on the other hand, includes digital devices as well as mechanical. People interested in horology are called horologists. This term can refer to both people who work professionally with time-keeping devices as well as enthusiasts and scholars of horology.</p>

        <h1 class="horology-history">A Brief History of Horology</h1>
        <p class="horology-history">Horology dates back to the ancient Egyptians who eventually developed water clocks. These were later adopted by the ancient Greeks who called them clepsydrae. Other ancient time-keeping devices include the candle clock, timestick, hourglass, and sundial. Mayan civilizations used large stones and pyramids to plot the equinox and solstice. <br><br>The first mechanical clocks were invented in Europe in the 14th century. They became the standard time-keeping device until the pendulum clock was invented in 1656 by Christiaan Huygens. In the 1930s quartz oscillators were invented and were then followed by atomic clocks after World War II.</p>
