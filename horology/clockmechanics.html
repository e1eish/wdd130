                <hr class="pendulum-rule">
                <p>For a pendulum cock it all starts with a source of power. In this case it is a weight that is pulled or wound up by a person. This then gives it gravitational potential energy which will power the clock as it is converted into kinetic energy.

        <!-- <h1 class="horology-history">Further Explaination</h1> -->
        <p class="horology-history">Now that we have our power source, we need a way of controlling that power and releasing it in controlled intervals. That is where an escapement comes in. The escapement is the part of a clock that controls the release of power and is the component that makes that recognizable “tick-tock” sound. For a pendulum clock it is the pendulum as well as a special gear and fork. As the pendulum swings back and forth it moves a fork, called the anchor, that allows the special gear, which is connected to the power and is called the escape wheel, to turn. It does this by letting one of the long teeth pass and block the next until the pendulum has swung again. 
        <br><br>
        But how does the pendulum keep going? Shouldn't it eventually slow and come to a stop? For this there is a simple yet ingenious solution. Every time the anchor lets a tooth past because the anchor's points and the escape wheel's teeth are shaped in a certain way the teeth give the fork a little push keeping the pendulum swinging. Now that we have a way of keeping the time it is a simple matter of using gear ratios to get the hour, minute, and second hands moving correctly.</p>

                <h4>What About a Watch?</h4>
                <hr class="pendulum-rule">
                <p>Instead of using gravity a watch uses springs. For the main power source a mainspring is wound with the crown on the side of the watch. As for the escapment it uses a wheel connected to a spring that pushes the anchor by winding and unwinding with the wheel's momentum.
