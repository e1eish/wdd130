      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been looking into a subject that piqued your interest but all of the information was all over the place, so you had to go from website to website to find out more? If you are interested in horology, which is the study and measurement of time, and watchmaking then I have a website idea just for that. It is collection of information to get you started in the fascinating world of horology. It will have information on the history of horology, how a clock works, and how to do simple maintenance on a watch.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience for this website will be anyone who is interested in learning more about horology and how to maintain a watch. This will be appealing to males and females equally. Ages are not likely to include to anyone who is younger than twelve. From the ages of twelve to eighteen there is a likely to be moderate interest in the contents of the website. With current trends of younger adults becoming interested in things of the past there is a fair likelihood that the largest audience will be young adults from around the ages of eighteen to about thirty or thirty-five. There is still a good likelihood of site visits from older ages. It is important to note that this is simply speculation and has no data to base these conclusions on.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        What is horology and the history of horology?<br><br>Horology is the study and measurement of time. Clocks, watches, sundials, hourglasses, and digital timers are all examples of instruments that measure time. In the current day horology tends to refer to the study of mechanical timekeeping devices. Chronometry, on the other hand, includes digital devices as well as mechanical. People interested in horology are called horologists. This term can refer to both people who work professionally with time-keeping devices as well as enthusiasts and scholars of horology.<br><br>Horology dates back to the ancient Egyptians who eventually developed water clocks. These were later adopted by the ancient Greeks who called them clepsydrae. Other ancient time-keeping devices include the candle clock, timestick, hourglass, and sundial. Mayan civilizations used large stones and pyramids to plot the equinox and solstice. The first mechanical clocks were invented in Europe in the 14th century. They became the standard time-keeping device until the pendulum clock was invented in 1656 by Christiaan Huygens. In the 1930s quartz oscillators were invented and were then followed by atomic clocks after World War II.<br><br>(Current resources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horology, https://www.artsandcollections.com/article/horology-a-brief-history/#:~:text=The%20origins%20of%20horology&text=Horology%E2%80%94the%20study%20of%20the,to%20track%20the%20sun's%20movement. ) I will be getting better resources later.

      <h3>How Clocks Work</h3>
      <p>
        How a mechanical clock works<br><br>For a pendulum cock it all starts with a source of power. In this case it is a weight that is pulled or wound up by a person. This then gives it gravitational potential energy which will power the clock as it is converted into kinetic energy. Now that we have our power source, we need a way of controlling that power and releasing it in controlled intervals. That is where an escapement comes in. The escapement is the part of a clock that controls the release of power and is the component that makes that recognizable “tick-tock” sound. For a pendulum clock it is the pendulum as well as a special gear and fork. As the pendulum swings back and forth it moves a fork, called the anchor, that allows the special gear, which is connected to the power and is called the escape wheel, to turn. It does this by letting one of the long teeth pass and block the next until the pendulum has swung again. But how does the pendulum keep going? Shouldn't it eventually slow and come to a stop? For this there is a simple yet ingenious solution. Every time the anchor lets a tooth past because the anchor's points and the escape wheel's teeth are shaped in a certain way the teeth give the fork a little push keeping the pendulum swinging. Now that we have a way of keeping the time it is a simple matter of using gear ratios to get the hour, minute, and second hands moving correctly.

      <h3>Watch Maintenance</h3>
      <p>
        How to maintain a watch<br><br>First you must open the watch's case. Then you can start taking it apart. You start by taking off the dial. Then you take out the escapement. Then you start taking off each bridge and the gears and other pieces connected to it. Eventually you get to the barrel which houses the mainspring. The mainspring is the thing that powers the watch. When to twist the crown, you are winding the mainspring. Once you have taken it all apart you can put it into an ultrasonic cleaner or in a special watch cleaning machine which spins the parts in a cleaning solution. Now you can put the watch back together. Just go in reverse order and you should be fine.
